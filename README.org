* What is it?

Emacs comes with a SQL interpreter which is able to open a connection to databases and present you with a prompt you are probably familiar with (e.g. =mysql>=, =pgsql>=, =presto>=, etc.). This mode gives you the ability to do that for Presto.

* How do I get it?

The canonical repository for the source code is https://github.com/kat-co/sql-prestodb.

The recommended way to install the package is to utilize Emacs's =package.el= along with MELPA. To set this up, please follow MELPA's [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][getting started guide]], and then run =M-x package-install sql-presto=.

* How do I use it?

Within Emacs, run =M-x sql-presto=. You will be prompted by in the minibuffer for a server. Enter the correct server and you should be greeted by a SQLi buffer with a =presto>= prompt.

From there you can either type queries in this buffer, or open a =sql-mode= buffer and send chunks of SQL over to the SQLi buffer with the requisite key-chords.

* Contributing

Please open GitHub issues and issue pull requests. Prior to submitting a pull-request, please run =make=. This will perform some linting and attempt to compile the package.
