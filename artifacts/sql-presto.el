;;; Commentary:
;; * What is it?

;;   Emacs comes with a SQL interpreter which is able to open a connection
;;   to databases and present you with a prompt you are probably familiar
;;   with (e.g. `mysql>', `pgsql>', `presto>', etc.). This mode gives you
;;   the ability to do that for Presto.


;; * How do I get it?

;;   The canonical repository for the source code is
;;   [https://github.com/kat-co/sql-prestodb].

;;   The recommended way to install the package is to utilize Emacs's
;;   `package.el' along with MELPA. To set this up, please follow MELPA's
;;   [getting started guide], and then run `M-x package-install
;;   sql-presto'.


;;   [getting started guide] https://melpa.org/#/getting-started


;; * How do I use it?

;;   Within Emacs, run `M-x sql-presto'. You will be prompted by in the
;;   minibuffer for a server. Enter the correct server and you should be
;;   greeted by a SQLi buffer with a `presto>' prompt.

;;   From there you can either type queries in this buffer, or open a
;;   `sql-mode' buffer and send chunks of SQL over to the SQLi buffer with
;;   the requisite key-chords.


;; * Contributing

;;   Please open GitHub issues and issue pull requests. Prior to submitting
;;   a pull-request, please run `make'. This will perform some linting and
;;   attempt to compile the package.
